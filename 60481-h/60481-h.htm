      <div class='line'>The serene savage sitting in his tree</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Saw empires rise and fall,</div>
      <div class='line'>And moralized on their uncertainty.</div>
      <div class='line in8'>(He never rose at all!)</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He was full fat from god-sent droves of prey;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He was full calm from satisfied desire;</div>
      <div class='line'>He was full wise in that he chose to stay</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Free from ambition’s fire.</div>

      <div class='line'>Here is good store of what keeps man alive,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Seeking to change the normal lot of man,</div>
      <div class='line'>To lure him from this natural strife and care,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>With vague Utopian plan!</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here’s wealth and joy—why seek for any change?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Why labor for a more elaborate life?</div>

      <div class='line'>“Those who complain of savagery as low</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Are merely proven lazy, and too weak</div>

      <div class='line in8'>It is their needs that speak.</div>

      <div class='line'>Came two young children to their mother’s shelf</div>
      <div class='line in2'>(One was quite little, and the other big),</div>
      <div class='line'>And each in freedom calmly helped himself.</div>
      <div class='line in10'>(One was a pig.)</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The food was free and plenty for them both,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But one was rather dull and very small;</div>
      <div class='line'>So the big smarter brother, nothing loath,</div>
      <div class='line in10'>He took it all.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>At which the little fellow raised a yell</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which tired the other’s more æsthetic ears;</div>
      <div class='line'>He gave him here a crust, and there a shell</div>
      <div class='line in10'>To stop his tears.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He gave with pride, in manner calm and bland,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Finding the other’s hunger a delight;</div>
      <div class='line'>He gave with piety—his full left hand</div>
      <div class='line in10'>Hid from his right.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He gave and gave—O blessed Charity!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How sweet and beautiful a thing it is!</div>
      <div class='line'>How fine to see that big boy giving free</div>
      <div class='line in10'>What is not his!</div>
